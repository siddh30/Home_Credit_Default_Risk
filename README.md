# Home Credit Default Risk

Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.

Through this project we strive to ensure this is not the case. As a Kaggle challenge by Home Credit we have used various machine learning methods to predict their clients repayment abilities. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.
